### Theory and applied

Local Zipf's Law: Emergence of Zipf's Law for Firms

<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
There is extensive literature on the evolution of Zipf’s law for cities. However, this project addresses two theoretical gaps in the evidence for Zipf’s law. First, there is little dynamic information on the evolution of Zipf’s law for firms; most papers present a static snapshot. Second, it is unclear how lower and higher distribution orders interact in the actual context of markets and their industries. To investigate the first gap, I use historical data on near-population firm distribution from the 17th to 20th centuries for the UK and the 19th to 20th centuries for the Russian Empire. These data allow me to zoom in on the evolution of Zipf’s law down to the precise geocoded address. Regarding the second gap, I examine different orders of firm interactions—such as local markets, industries, and trade networks—to explain the general Zipf’s law.

A great discussion on why this is important is available on MathOverflow [here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/39224/is-there-a-natural-random-process-that-is-rigorously-known-to-produce-zipfs-law).
