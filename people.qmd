## Packages in STATA

### [hysi package](https://github.com/kkushnarev/HySI)

**Hybrid Confidence Intervals for LASSO Selection**

The `hysi` package implements the *Hybrid Confidence Interval* (HySI) method in Stata for valid inference after LASSO-based model selection.  The method, proposed by [McCloskey (2024)](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/111/1/109/7085586?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false), combines the PoSI framework with a selective intervals approach by [Lee et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6238) to construct confidence intervals that remain valid regardless of the model selected.

#### Installation

To install the hysi package in Stata, run:

```stata
. net install hysi, replace from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kkushnarev/hysi/main/")
```
