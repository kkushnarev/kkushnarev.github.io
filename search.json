    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

I am currently working on a project that links 18th- and 19th-century business and manufacturing micro-data for multiply countries to explore questions from a comparative perspective on the British Industrial Revolution. A summary of my research is here.\nI received my undergraduate degree in Economics from Plekhanov Russian University of Economics, where I was awarded the university-wide prize, Plekhanov Pride, for best graduate. I received an MSc with Distinction in Economic History (Research) from the London School of Economics, where my master’s dissertation was awarded first prize in the Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence and the Bank of England program.\nI publish data, coding, and applied econometrics, including new Stata packages and linkage algorithms, here. Also, I run a pro-bono course on Russian Economic History for graduate students and anyone interested. The syllabus and lectures can be found here, with the next enrollment in Fall 2025.\nYou can find my CV here. My email is kushnark at tcd dot ie."
