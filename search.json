International Journal of Advanced Smart Convergence, 10, 1–11 (in Eng.). [pdf]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nDocument page segmentation is an important step in building a quality optical character recognition module. The study examined already existing work on the topic of page segmentation and focused on the development of a segmentation model that has greater functional significance for application in an organisation, as well as broad capabilities for managing the quality of the model. The main problems of document segmentation were highlighted, which include a complex background of intersecting objects. As classes for detection, not only classic text, tables and figures were selected, but also additional types, such as signatures, logos and tables without borders (or with partially missing borders). This made it possible to pose a non-trivial task of detecting nonstandard document elements. The authors compared existing neural network architectures for object detection based on published research data. The most suitable architecture was RetinaNet. To ensure the possibility of quality control of the model, a method based on neural network modelling using the RetinaNet architecture is proposed. During the study, several models were built, the quality of which was assessed on the test sample using the mean average precision metric. The best result among the constructed algorithms was shown by a model that includes four neural networks: the focus of the first neural network is on detecting tables and tables without borders, the second – seals and signatures, the third – pictures and logos, and the fourth – text. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that the approach based on four neural networks showed the best results in accordance with the objectives of the study on the test sample in the context of most classes of detection. The method proposed in the article can be used to recognise other objects. A promising direction in which the analysis can be continued is the segmentation of tables; the areas of the table that differ in function will act as classes: heading, cell with a name, cell with data, and empty cell.\n\n\n\n\nKushnarev, K.

В настоящее время я работаю над проектом, который связывает микро-данные о бизнесе и промышленности 18-го и 19-го веков для нескольких стран, для изучения сравнительной перспективы Британской промышленной революции. Краткое описание моих исследовательских интересов можно найти здесь.\nЯ получил степень бакалавра по экономике в Российском экономическом университете имени Плеханова, где был удостоен университетской награды «Плехановская гордость» как лучший выпускник. Затем я получил степень магистра (MSc) с отличием по экономической истории (исследовательский трек) в Лондонской школе экономики. Моя магистерская диссертация заняла первое место в программе ESCoE и Банка Англии.\nЯ публикую данные, код и прикладные эконометрические исследования, включая новые пакеты Stata и алгоритмы работы с данными, здесь. Также я провожу бесплатный курс по экономической истории России для аспирантов и всех желающих. Программа и лекции доступны здесь, следующая запись – осенью 2025 года.\nЯ также вёл YouTube-шоу «Книжная экономика», прошлые выпуски можно найти здесь.

    "title": "Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."
