    "text": "Kushnarev, K. (2024). Labour market concentration since the British Industrial Revolution. Working Paper. [pdf] [slides]\nCovered by Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper highlights an economic history perspective on labour share dynamics during the second phase of the British Industrial Revolution. It addresses two broad questions: 1) Did market concentration increase between 1851 and 1911? 2) If so, did the labour share decline, as suggested by ongoing debates? I use census data from 1851 to 1911 to answer these questions, focusing on local labour markets. Employing different specifications of market concentration, I found a surprising doubling in market concentration during this period, as measured by both the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and Concentration Ratio approaches. However, local labour market concentration decreased as the labour market expanded. I further explore this by providing a counterfactual analysis, showing that a one standard deviation increase in creative destruction leads to a 50% rise in new entrants. Consequently, I offer two explanations for the presented results. The first is that local labour market concentration is more suitable for analysing labour share, making it a more practical and data-driven approach. The second explanation is that the decline and rise of labour share trigger uneven growth through redistribution and creative destruction. This explanation is more theoretical but still supports my results. In the future, a greater focus on the first stage of the British Industrial Revolution could lead to the developing of a more grounded theory.\n\n\n\n\nKushnarev, K. (2024). Spillover effects from chess, 1891–2021. Working Paper. [pdf]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper explores the formation of upper-tail human capital under socialism and its longstanding impact on economic and political participation. Based on this motivation, I have developed a model of the interplay between economic and intellectual life, where intellectual competition in chess explains the variation of economic and political participation once it becomes available. I have collected a novel dataset of of chess players between 1891 and 2021 in the three levels of tournaments: local (cities and towns), republics, and international competitions held in the USSR and, after 1991, in Russia. Based on the data, I have found a variation in chess competitiveness by the level of tournaments and geographical units. It accounts for a more than 6 times decrease in the local competitiveness in the 30-s and, more importantly, in the 70-s and 80-s. Furthermore, this variation allows me to frame future opportunities to explore causal relationships between chess competitiveness and a) the probability of city participation in the cooperative movement, introduced in 1989; b) the exposure of political protest activities in 2007-2017 at the level of the city.\n\n\n\n\nOn the future development of working papers in the Research Statement."

    "text": "Kushnarev, K., Sokerin, P., & Volkova, A. (2021). Object detection in financial reporting documents for subsequent recognition. International Journal of Advanced Smart Convergence, 10, 1–11 (in Eng.). [pdf]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nDocument page segmentation is an important step in building a quality optical character recognition module. The study examined already existing work on the topic of page segmentation and focused on the development of a segmentation model that has greater functional significance for application in an organisation, as well as broad capabilities for managing the quality of the model. The main problems of document segmentation were highlighted, which include a complex background of intersecting objects. As classes for detection, not only classic text, tables and figures were selected, but also additional types, such as signatures, logos and tables without borders (or with partially missing borders). This made it possible to pose a non-trivial task of detecting nonstandard document elements. The authors compared existing neural network architectures for object detection based on published research data. The most suitable architecture was RetinaNet. To ensure the possibility of quality control of the model, a method based on neural network modelling using the RetinaNet architecture is proposed. During the study, several models were built, the quality of which was assessed on the test sample using the mean average precision metric. The best result among the constructed algorithms was shown by a model that includes four neural networks: the focus of the first neural network is on detecting tables and tables without borders, the second – seals and signatures, the third – pictures and logos, and the fourth – text. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that the approach based on four neural networks showed the best results in accordance with the objectives of the study on the test sample in the context of most classes of detection. The method proposed in the article can be used to recognise other objects. A promising direction in which the analysis can be continued is the segmentation of tables; the areas of the table that differ in function will act as classes: heading, cell with a name, cell with data, and empty cell.\n\n\n\n\nKushnarev, K.

The author highlights the synthesis of economic and political rhetoric within the framework of institutional theory. Building on this tradition, the author empirically demonstrates the transformations of Kuznets cycles from 1905 to 2016 in a step-by-step manner.

(2020). Economic views of S. Kuznets and the reception of the theory of medium-term cycles in the political economy narrative. University Bulletin, 8, 88–101 (in Rus.).

It analyzes the major works of Kuznets and his advisor, Wesley C. Mitchell, and traces the influence of Kuznets’ methodological approach on the development of economic theory. The paper also examines how the mechanics of Kuznets’ research are received in modern political economy, particularly in the works of Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. The appendix includes a brief analysis of the political interpretation of Kuznets’ cycle theory as proposed by Acemoglu and Robinson. Overall, the article synthesizes previous research on Kuznets’ economic views and highlights the relevance of his experiential approach for contemporary analysis.\n\n\n\n\nKushnarev, K., et al. (2020). The mechanism of self-regulation of the art market as a factor of counteraction to the legalization of financial flows. Financial Research, 4, 94–108 (in Rus.). [pdf]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nPurpose. The aim of this article is to analyze the main mechanisms for countering money laundering in the art market across four economic regions: the United States, the European Union, South Africa, and Russia.\nStructure/Methodology/Approach. The article consists of five sections, focusing on an analysis of the current state of the art market and the development of a model to combat money laundering within it. The authors adopt a general economic approach to the study, while also emphasizing the importance of institutional methodology for analyzing the process in question.\nFindings. The article provides an assessment of the current state of anti-money laundering efforts in Russia’s art market. It highlights a lack of academic research on the mechanisms of money laundering in this sector and, consequently, an insufficient understanding of the policies aimed at combating it. The authors present their own perspective on the future development of anti-money laundering measures in the Russian art market.\nOriginality/Value. The institutional model of regulation proposed for the art market can serve as a foundation for developing a regulatory framework based on the principle of self-regulation. This approach could help avoid excessive regulatory pressure on market participants. The authors argue that the development of a national strategy to counter money laundering in emerging markets—particularly in the art market—must be brought to the forefront of policy discussions without delay.\n\n\n\n\nKushnarev, K., & Bolvachev, A. (2020). Mathematical and statistical model of price formation in the art market: finance and market equilibrium. Financial Management, 1, 51–63 (in Rus.). [pdf]\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThe article examines the specific features of price formation for art objects. The authors highlight the ambiguity of approaches to valuing works of art and the unique mechanisms and institutions of the art market. A mathematical and statistical model is proposed, explaining price formation as a result of the equilibrium between supply and demand. The article argues that the art market remains under-researched in Russian-language academic discourse. At the same time, it introduces an approach to studying the art market that has not previously been applied in Russian-language papers. The role and nature of finance in shaping art prices are also analyzed. This article may be of interest to auction houses as key institutions of the art market, as well as to both theoretical and applied economists and anyone interested in art.\n\n\n\n\nKushnarev, K., & Smirnova, Ya.

Byrne and the non-classical concept proposed by R. Montoya. A two-factor model of interpersonal attraction is presented for readers’ consideration. The article also provides a list of promising research methods for studying attractiveness, aimed at scholars working in this field.

    "title": "Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."
